## Highlights
- The arrival is inevitable: Death. A unanimous end, a unified destination. A noun without regard. Our eulogy. Written. Lived. The approach is relative: Life. A singular procession, our personal journey. A verb with regard. Our résumé. Write it. Live it. ([Location 144](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B086823SWK&location=144))

- The inevitability of a situation is not relative; when we accept the outcome of a given situation as inevitable, then how we choose to deal with it is relative. We either persist and continue in our present pursuit of a desired result, pivot and take a new tack to get it, or concede altogether and tally one up for fate. We push on, call an audible, or wave the white flag and live to fight another day. ([Location 173](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B086823SWK&location=173))
