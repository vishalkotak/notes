Router helps sending packets from source to destination. Two things are needed for this: a way to address nodes (IP address) and a mechanism to send packets. To decide where to send a packet, a router needs to consult a local routing table. The table maps a destination address to the address of the next router along the path. The responsibility of building and communicating the routing tables across routers lies with the Border Gateway Protocol (BGP).
