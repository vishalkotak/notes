### Dot Product
- The dot product of two vectors is calculated by multiplying corresponding components and then summing the results.
- For example, the dot product of vectors `u = [u1, u2, ..., un]` and `v = [v1, v2, ..., vn]` is `u · v = u1v1 + u2v2 + ... + unvn`.
- The dot product results in a single number (a scalar)
### Matrix Multiplication
- Matrix multiplication is a more general operation involving two matrices.
- For example, if `A` is an `m x n` matrix and `B` is an `n x p` matrix, then their product `AB` is an `m x p` matrix.
- Each element in the resulting matrix is calculated by taking the dot product of the corresponding row from the first matrix and the corresponding column from the second matrix.
