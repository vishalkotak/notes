Minification, also known as minimization, is the process of removing all unnecessary characters from JavaScript source code without altering its functionality. This includes the removal of whitespace, comments, and semicolons, along with the use of shorter variable names and functions. Minification of JavaScript code results in compact file size.

##### Why don't developers write code using mimification
- JavaScript code is written for, and by, humans, who need whitespace, formatting, and comments to be able to understand and debug the code. After the code is written, minifying software can be used in order to improve performance. This is because browsers can execute code without needing to understand it.
##### Disadvantages
- Minification can break complicated scripts because of site-dependent variables like themes, plugins, and server environment.
-  On its own, it might not provide significant gains.
